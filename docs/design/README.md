# UI Mockups

The images in this directory are mockups of the AncientLingo mobile application provided by the product owner.  They illustrate the desired look and feel for core screens.  Use these as inspiration when building components for the mobile app and when translating layouts to the web.

| File       | Description                                              |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `home.png`    | Home screen with day streak, language progress bars and quick actions |
| `library.png` | Library screen listing curated manuscripts with categories and metadata |
| `reader.png`  | Reading screen showing interlinear mode (Greek and English) with navigation controls |

These mockups are not final designs.  As you implement the UI, adhere to best practices for accessibility (contrast, font sizes) and responsive design.  Feel free to iterate on the visuals while preserving the core concepts: progress tracking, clear navigation, and engaging reading experiences.
